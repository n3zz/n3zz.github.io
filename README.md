# Fancy seeing you here!
This is my Portfolio Website V1! Thank you for taking the time to appreciate the code for it :)

I am by no means a web developer (yet..) however, this is just one of the many fun projects I do in my spare time xP

# Be ready
Version 2.0 is where things will get a bit more interesting ;)
