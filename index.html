                Hello, I am Ary!
                <br></br>
                My real name is Amritesh. I have the online aliases: Ary, n3zz, ary_yakos, tesh. I go by many names. 
                I am a 19 year old computer science student aspiring to pursue a career in Cyber Security.
                As you can see I have somewhat prior knowledge in Web Design.
                I have about 7+ years in coding experience. I am currently also learning Java, PHP and JavaScript to gain further knowledge in website development. I have experience in both Python (Flask and Django) and JS (React) Web frameworks. More details in my <a href="#projects">Portfolio</a>.
                <br></br>
                In addition to programming, I have deep passion for video games and seeing what makes them tick. When I am not digging around in cyber security research or tinkering with my raspberry pi, I would look at making text based adventure game prototypes. I also code on games in working with my friends and the people in a small discord server that I run called <a id="tpdc" href="https://tpdc.club" target=blank>The Pseudo Dopamine Centre</a>.
                <br></br>
                My first hand experience with cyber security is my main experience with Cyber Discovery and my own experience with Kali Linux and GNS and Cisco Packet Tracer. I also tried practical skills on legal hacking sites such as <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/" target=blank>OverTheWire</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" target=blank>HackTheBox</a> I know all the basics it requires to make a network safe and secure as possible. Additionally I am also working on getting my Security+ and CEH.

            <section class="container" id="projects">
                The variety of projects I have worked on range from Web Design to Scripting to Full on breaking machines and conducting cyber operations on said practice machines. There is also programming applications in said interested fields. Most of my projects aim to combine both my passion for education, cyber security as well the concept of gamification.
                Most of these projects are open source and will be available at my <a href="https://github.com/n3zz">Github</a>.
